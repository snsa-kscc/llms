Among the regions with big increases in homes was the north-west, including in parts of Blackpool and Burnley and other northern cities such as Bradford. Children’s services directors warned that the trends were driven by the “blatant profiteering” of private care providers, targeting cheap housing and local labour.\n",

However, it also means vulnerable children can end up being moved hundreds of miles for a care place, splitting them from family and support networks that they rely on. It comes after the Observer revealed that some children were being moved to care homes more than 300 miles away from their neighbourhoods.\n",
